Feature: Run `kitchen test` Rake tasks on individual instances and full collection
  In order to run `kitchen test` tasks with minimal setup under CI environments
  As an operator or CI script
  I want to run a Rake command to run `kitchen test` executions

  Background:
    Given a file named "Rakefile" with:
    """
    require "pp"; pp ENV
    require "kitchen/rake_tasks"
    Kitchen::RakeTasks.new
    """
    Given a file named ".kitchen.yml" with:
    """

      name: dummy

    provisioner:

    platforms:
      - name: cool
      - name: beans

    suites:
