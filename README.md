A convergence integration test harness for configuration management systems.

# Getting started


Project Setup
-------------

In your `Gemfile`, add `test-kitchen` as a
dependency:

```ruby
gem 'test-kitchen', git: 'git://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen.git', branch: '1.0'
```

and run the `bundle` command to install:

    $ bundle install

This will expose the `test-kitchen` CLI. Run `bundle exec kitchen init` to get started:

    $ kitchen init

You will be prompted with a series of questions. In this guide, we
will be using the [kitchen vagrant driver](https://github.com/opscode/kitchen-vagrant).

```text
$ bundle exec kitchen init
      create  .kitchen.yml
      append  Rakefile
      create  test/integration/default
      append  .gitignore
      append  .gitignore
      Add a Driver plugin to your Gemfile?
      (y/n)> y
      Enter gem name, `list', or `skip'>
      kitchen-vagrant
      append  Gemfile
      You must run `bundle install' to fetch any new gems.
```

Run the `bundle` command again to install the new vagrant driver:

    $ bundle install

Open up the `.kitchen.yml` file created in the root of your
repository.

Now, it is time to get testing. Use the `--parallel` option to run
your tests in parallel. Trust us, it's faster!

    $ bundle exec kitchen test

### Helpful Switches

 - `--destroy=always|passed|never`
   - `passed` (default): destroy the machine after a successful test
     run (which implies passing tests.)
   - `never`: Never clean up builds, even if they pass or fail.
   - `always`: Regardless of the success or failure of the build,
     destroy the machine.
 - `--log-level=debug|info|warn|error|fatal` - Set the log-level of
     the entire stack, including the chef-solo run. 

## The Kitchen YAML format

Test-Kitchen reads its configuration from the .kitchen.yml
configuration file at the root of your cookbook. It closely resembles
the format of .travis.yml which is intentional.

There are 4 stanzas in .kitchen.yml, driver_plugin, driver_config,
platforms, and suites. driver_plugin, platforms, and suites are
currently required. driver_config can optionally be used to set values
for all platforms defined.

The driver_plugin stanza is only one line long and defines which
driver is used by test-kitchen.

The platforms stanza defines individual virtual machines. Additional
driver_config, node attributes, and run_list can be defined in this stanza

The suites stanza defines sets of tests that you intend to be run on
each platform. A run_list and node attributes can be defined for each
suite. The run_list and node attributes will be merged with that of
each platform. In case of the conflict, the attributes defined on the
suite will triumph.

```yaml

---
driver_plugin: vagrant

platforms:
- name: ubuntu-12.04
  driver_config:
    box: opscode-ubuntu-12.04
    box_url: https://opscode-vm.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/boxes/opscode-ubuntu-12.04.box

- name: centos-6.3
  driver_config:
    box: opscode-centos-6.3
    box_url: https://opscode-vm.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/boxes/opscode-centos-6.3.box
  run_list:
  - recipe[yum::epel]

suites:
- name: stock_system_and_user
  run_list:
  - recipe[user::data_bag]
  - recipe[rvm::system]
  - recipe[rvm::user]
  attributes:
    users:
    - wigglebottom
    rvm:
      user_installs:
      - user: wigglebottom
        default_ruby: 1.8.7
```

## Overriding .kitchen.yaml with .kitchen.<driver>.local.yml

## A Note

This project is currently in rapid development which means frequent releases,
potential for massive refactorings (that could be API breaking), and minimal
to no documentation. This will change as the project transitions to be used in
production environments.
